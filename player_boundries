//when player should have have limits in his area of moving. try this code. This line of code should be added to the 
//player movement script.
This is only applicable if the player movemnt is done using "transform.position" parameters.
//try the following

void Update(){
  movement();
}

void movement(){

        float h = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"); //read X axis 
        float v = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");  //read Y axis

        Vector3 move = new Vector3(h,v,0); 
        move = move.normalized * speed * Time.deltaTime;
        obj.transform.position += move;
        obj.transform.position = new Vector3(Mathf.Clamp(obj.transform.position.x,-20,+20f),obj.transform.position.y,0); //clamping the are aof movement in nx axis.

    }
